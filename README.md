# B.Tech(IT/CS)

In the B.Tech(IT) program, students are required to complete practicals starting from the 3rd semester. These practicals are designed to provide hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of the concepts learned in the theoretical courses. The practicals cover a wide range of topics such as programming languages, database management systems, networking, web development, and software engineering. Students are expected to apply their knowledge to solve real-world problems and develop practical skills that are essential in the IT industry. 

The practicals are usually conducted in well-equipped computer labs under the supervision of experienced faculty members. Through these practicals, students not only enhance their technical skills but also learn to work in teams, improve problem-solving abilities, and develop critical thinking. Overall, the practical component of the B.Tech(IT) program plays a crucial role in shaping competent IT professionals and prepares them for successful careers in the field.

[C Practicals (3rd Sem)](https://github.com/SauRavRwT/Practicals/tree/main/3rdSem/C)

C is a general-purpose programming language created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is one of the most widely used programming languages for developing system software, application software, and embedded software.

[Computational Methods in C (3rd Sem)](https://github.com/SauRavRwT/Practicals/tree/main/3rdSem/CM)

"Computational methods" generally refer to the use of algorithms, mathematical models, and numerical techniques to solve problems through computation. These methods are widely applied across various disciplines and fields to analyze, simulate, and optimize complex systems.

[Data Structure in C (3rd Sem)](https://github.com/SauRavRwT/Practicals/tree/main/3rdSem/DS)

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently. It defines a set of operations that can be performed on the data, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and searching. The choice of a data structure depends on the nature of the data and the operations that need to be performed.

[Oops in c++ (3rd Sem)](https://github.com/SauRavRwT/Practicals/tree/main/4thSem/OOPS)

The most common interpretation is that "CPP" stands for C++. C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language. It provides object-oriented programming features and is widely used for software development.

[Database Management System in MySql (4th Sem)](https://github.com/SauRavRwT/Practicals/tree/main/4thSem/DBMS)

DBMS stands for "Database Management System." It is software that provides an interface for interacting with databases and manages the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data.

[Java (4th Sem)](https://github.com/SauRavRwT/Practicals/tree/main/4thSem/JAVA)

Java is a high-level, versatile, and object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle)
Java is designed around the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, allowing developers to create modular and reusable code.

[Probablity. Statics and Linear programming in Scilab (4th Sem)](https://github.com/SauRavRwT/Practicals/tree/main/4thSem/PSLP)

Scilab has functions for probability distributions and statistical operations. For example, you can use the rand() function to generate random numbers from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. If you're interested in other distributions like normal distribution, you might use functions like randn().

Scilab has built-in functions for basic statistical operations such as mean, standard deviation, correlation, etc.

For linear programming problems, you might use Scilab's optimization toolbox. The linprog function can be used to solve linear programming problems.

[Compiler Design in C/C++ (5th Sem)](https://github.com/SauRavRwT/Practicals/tree/main/5thSem/CD)

Compiler design involves creating a software program that translates high-level source code written in a programming language into machine code or an intermediate code. Writing a complete compiler is a complex task, and it typically involves multiple stages, such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.

[Data Analysis and Algorith in Java (5th Sem)](https://github.com/SauRavRwT/Practicals/tree/main/5thSem/DAA)

"Design and Analysis of Algorithms" (DAA) is a field within computer science that focuses on the study of algorithms, their design, analysis, and implementation. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems, and they are fundamental to computer science and programming.

[Operating System in C/C++ (5th Sem)](https://github.com/SauRavRwT/Practicals/tree/main/5thSem/OS)

An Operating System (OS) is a software program that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and the computer user. Its primary purpose is to provide a set of services that allow users and applications to interact with the computer hardware in an organized and efficient manner.
It serves as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, handling tasks such as process management, memory management, file system management, and device management. Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix.
